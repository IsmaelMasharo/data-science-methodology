## **Data Science Methodology**

* The flowchart is highly iterative.
* The flowchart never ends.

### Business understanding
* Clarification -whats do goal
* Starts with a general question:		
	◦ como asignar mejor los fondos
	◦ como reconocer de donde es un plato
* After clarification: 		
	◦ como asignar mejor los fondos EN BASE A la reincidencia de pasientes 	 
	◦ como reconocer de donde es un plato EN BASE A el nombre del plato? a los ingredientes del plato.

### Analytic approach

* This step entails expressing the problem in the context of statistical and machine-learning techniques.
* it helps identify what type of patterns will be needed to address the question most effectively.

### Data Understanding


* is the data we collected relevant to the question to be answer? 
* EDA can be done? descriptive statistic? if so, 
* is this description relevant? if not, then iterate back to data collection
* does missing means anything? (aka encoded values such as -1, 0, 999, none, etc)


### Data Preparation


* cleaning, transforming
* what are the ways in which data is prepared? in a way that addresses missing values, remove duplicates
* feature engineering, based on domain knowledge

* "it takes one bad ingredient to ruin the meal"

### Modeling


* sample the sauces and check if is ready or it needs more seasoning

* understand the question at hand
* select analytical approach to solve the problem
* obtain, understand, preparer and model the data

* have i've made enough to eat?


### Evaluation

* does do model used really answer the initial question
* diagnostic face
* statistical significance testing face - data is being properly handled and interpreted?
* tunning
* ROC curve for comparing different models performance


### Deployment

* solution owner
* market
* application developers
* it administrators
* translate the model results: assimilate knowledge for business


### Feedback

* refine model
* adjustment based on the feedback
* the more you know the more you want to know
* record the subjects of study, review after a year
* redeployment with the feedback adjustments
* newly available data source or refining
